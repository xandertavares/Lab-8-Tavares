    "\n",
    "Let $(x,y)$ be an unknown point whose respective distances to the two points, $d_1$ and $d_2$, are known. The Pythagorean theorem allows us to express $x$ and $y$ (the coordinates of the unknown point) in terms of $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$, $d_1$, and $d_2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_1^{2} = (x - x_1)^{2} + (y - y_1)^{2}$$\n",

    "$$ d_2^{2} = (x - x_2)^{2} + (y - y_2)^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverting these two formulae to make them explicit in $x$ and $y$ is really a lot of fun, but it takes a while. Here is the final result:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{2(1 + b^2)} \\left[ 2 [x_1 - b(a - y_1)] \\pm [4(b(a - y_1) - x_1)^2 - 4(1 + b^2)(x_1^{2} - d_1^{2} + (y_1 - a)^{2})]^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\right] $$\n",

    "Note that the two possible values for $x$, $x_+$ and $x_-$, arise from the positive and negative sense of the square root, and the value of $y$ derives from its particular $x$. So because of the power of 2 in the Pythagorean theorem, we find that there are **two possible points**, $(x_+, y_+)$ and $(x_-, y_-)$, that are each $d_1$ from $(x_1, y_1)$ and $d_2$ from $(x_2, y_2)$. These are shown by the star and cross in the figure below.\n",
